# Personal Blog Web App

This project is a personal blog website built using Django as the backend framework and JavaScript for the frontend interactions. The website allows users to create accounts, write and publish blog posts, comment on posts, and customize their posts. The project utilizes Bootstrap CSS for styling and responsiveness.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

The personal blog web app satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements in the following ways:

- **Distinctiveness**: The project goes beyond the scope of the other projects in the course by providing users with a platform to express themselves through blog posts. It's not a simple CRUD application but a full-fledged blogging platform with user authentication, commenting functionality, and dynamic frontend interactions.

- **Complexity**: The web app integrates both Django and JavaScript for a seamless user experience. It incorporates user authentication, multiple models (users, posts, comments), and user-specific customization of posts. The complexity lies in the interactions between the frontend and backend, the dynamic rendering of content, and the integration of multiple features.
